Constitution of the United Diffs
================================

Introduction
------------

This aim of this document is to detail the guiding principles that can be
referred to when making decisions over affairs such as corporate sponsorship,
events and venues.

This document is written in markdown format and stored on github.

- Simple document structure (to aid in keeping things to-the-point)
- Transparency for all
- Amendment history

Any proposed amendments should be made via pull request. Using the code review
tools there gives us good context for any discussion that needs to take place
before ratifying them.

And yes, maybe I do spend a bit too much time reading American political
history.
